Goal:

Performed supervised learning for predicting a label for given test data, using the model that is trained on labeled training data. 
Used different machine learning techniques like Na√Øve Beyesian and Logistic Regression. Used data from twitter database for generating training and test data.

Tasks:
1. The file 'train.csv' contains information about the tweets in a csv file. The data is preprocessed using appropriate transformation rules.
2. The feature extractor is used to convert each input TRAINING data to a feature set. I used 'terms and frequency bag-of-words feature' for this purpose.
3. The pairs of features and labels are inputted into the machine learning algorithm to train a model(Naive Bayesian or Logistice Regression)
4. During the prediction phase, the same feature extractor is applied on the TEST data, and the extracted feature sets are inputted into the model to generate the predicted labels.
5. The accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score of the classfier developed are tested on training data and test data. 
6. Different experiements are conducted to reduce overfitting in the developed classifiers and improve the accuracy, f1-measure on the test data.
